There are several types of linked lists, each serving different purposes based on their structure and the way nodes are connected. The main types of linked lists are:

### 1. **Singly Linked List**
   - **Structure**: Each node contains two elements: data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence.
   - **Traversal**: Can only be traversed in one direction (from the head to the tail).
   - **Example**: A → B → C → D → NULL.
   
### 2. **Doubly Linked List**
   - **Structure**: Each node contains three elements: data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
   - **Traversal**: Can be traversed in both forward and backward directions.
   - **Example**: NULL ← A ↔ B ↔ C ↔ D → NULL.
   
### 3. **Circular Linked List**
   - **Structure**: Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node's next pointer points back to the head, forming a loop.
   - **Traversal**: Can be continuously traversed in a circular manner starting from any node.
   - **Example**: A → B → C → D → A (head).
   
### 4. **Doubly Circular Linked List**
   - **Structure**: Similar to a doubly linked list, but the last node's next pointer points to the head, and the head’s previous pointer points to the last node.
   - **Traversal**: Can be traversed in both directions circularly, from any node.
   - **Example**: NULL ← A ↔ B ↔ C ↔ D → A.
